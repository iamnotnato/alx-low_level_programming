<h3>Project : 0x03-debugging</h3>

<h4>Essentials:</h4>

* [main.h](./main.h) : A Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.

<h4>List of Tasks:</h4>

* **0. Multiple mains**
  * File : [0-main.c](./0-main.c)
  * File : [main.h](./main.h)
  <br>
  Required : This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
  <br>
  Expected Results : You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code, you may change only one line in this task.

* **1. Like, comment, subscribe**
  *  File : [1-main.c](./1-main.c)
   <br>
  Required : Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
  <br>
  Expected Results : Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
  
* **2. 0 > 972?**
  * File : [2-largest_number.c](./2-largest_number.c)
  * File : [main.h](./main.h)
   <br>
  Required : This program prints the largest of three integers.
  <br>
  Expected Results : Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
  
* **3. Leap year**
  * File : [3-print_remaining_days.c](./3-print_remaining_days.c)
  * File : [main.h](./main.h)
  <br>
  Required : This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
  <br>
  Expected Results : Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
