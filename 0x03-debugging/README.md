<h4>Essentials:</h4>

* [main.h](./main.h) : A Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.

> ✒️ **List of Tasks:**
<br>

* **0. Multiple mains**
  * File : [0-main.c](./0-main.c)
  * File : [main.h](./main.h)
    * Required : This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
    * Expected Results : You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code, you may change only one line in this task.
<br>
  
* **1. Like, comment, subscribe**
  * File : [1-main.c](./1-main.c)
    * Required : Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
    * Expected Results : Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.

> 📚 *Book : Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube's Chaotic Rise to World Domination is a book by Mark Bergen*

<br>
    
* **2. 0 > 972?**
  * File : [2-largest_number.c](./2-largest_number.c)
  * File : [main.h](./main.h)
    * Required : This program prints the largest of three integers.
    * Expected Results : Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
    
> 💡*Fun Fact : Pill with imprint b 972 1 0 is Blue, Elliptical/Oval and has been identified as Amphetamine and Dextroamphetamine 10 mg.*

<br>

* **3. Leap year**
  * File : [3-print_remaining_days.c](./3-print_remaining_days.c)
  * File : [main.h](./main.h)
    * Required : This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
    * Expected Results : Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
