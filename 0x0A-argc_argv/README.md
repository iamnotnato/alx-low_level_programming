<h3>Project : 0x0A. C - argc, argv</h3>
<br>

<h4>Essentials:</h4>

* [main.h](./main.h) : A Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.
* [_putchar.c](./_putchar.c) : A C function that writes a character to `stdout`.

<h4>List of Tasks:</h4>
<br>

* **0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to**
  * File : [0-whatsmyname.c](./0-whatsmyname.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A program that prints its name, followed by a new line.
    * Expected Results : 
      * **If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again**
      * **You should not remove the path before the name of the program**

* **1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together**
  * File : [1-print_rev_recursion.c](./1-print_rev_recursion.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that prints a string in reverse.

* **2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange**
  * File : [2-strlen_recursion.c](./2-strlen_recursion.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that returns the length of a string.

> ðŸ’¡Fun Fact :
> * **Cobb : "Well dreams, they feel real while we're in them, right? It's only when we wake up that we realize how things are actually strange."**
> * **"Let me ask you a question, you, you never really remember the beginning of a dream do you? You always wind up right in the middle of what's going on."**

* **3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling**
  * File : [3-factorial.c](./3-factorial.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that returns the factorial of a given number.
    * Expected Results : 
      * **If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error.**
      * **Factorial of 0 is 1.**

> ðŸ’¡Fun Fact :
> * **"You Mustn't Be Afraid To Dream A Little Bigger Darling" is a memorable quote uttered by Tom Hardy to Joseph Gordon Levitt from the 2010 film Inception.**
<br>

* **4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate**
  * File : [4-pow_recursion.c](./4-pow_recursion.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
    * Expected Results : If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1

> ðŸ’¡Fun Fact : 
> * **"Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate. An idea that is fully formed - fully understood - that sticks; right in there somewhere.**

<br>
  
* **5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer**
  * File : [5-sqrt_recursion.c](./5-sqrt_recursion.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that returns the natural square root of a number.
    * Expected Results : If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1.

> ðŸ’¡**Fun Fact : â€œArthur : Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer; me. Inception (2010)**

<br>

* **6. Inception. Is it possible?**
  * File : [6-is_prime_number.c](./6-is_prime_number.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A  a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

>ðŸ’¡*Fun Fact : â€œSaito: Inception. Is it possible? Inception (2010)*

* **7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything**
  * File : [100-is_palindrome.c](./100-is_palindrome.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.
    * Note : An empty string is a palindrome

* **8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...**
  * File : [101-wildcmp.c](./101-wildcmp.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.
    * Expected Results : 
      * **s2 can contain the special character *.**
      * **The special char * can replace any string (including an empty string)**
