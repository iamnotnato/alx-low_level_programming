<h3>Project : 0x0A. C - argc, argv</h3>
<br>

<h4>Essentials:</h4>

* [main.h](./main.h) : A Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.
* [_putchar.c](./_putchar.c) : A C function that writes a character to `stdout`.

<h4>List of Tasks:</h4>
<br>

* **0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to**
  * File : [0-whatsmyname.c](./0-whatsmyname.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A program that prints its name, followed by a new line.
    * Expected Results : 
      * **If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again**
      * **You should not remove the path before the name of the program**

  * File : [1-args.c](./1-args.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.
    * Expected Results : Your program should print a number, followed by a new line.

* **2. The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter**
  * File : [2-args.c](./2-args.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A program that prints all arguments it receives.
    * Expected Results : 
      * **All arguments should be printed, including the first one**
      * **Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line**

<br>

> **This quotation is usually attributed to Winston Churchill but there is no evidence he ever said it.**

<br>
  
* **3. Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument**
  * File : [3-mul.c](./3-mul.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A program that multiplies two numbers.
    * Expected Results : 
      * **Your program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line**
      * **You can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer**
      * **If the program does not receive two arguments,**
        * **Your program should print Error,followed by a new line, and return 1**

> ðŸ’¡Fun Fact :
> * **"You Mustn't Be Afraid To Dream A Little Bigger Darling" is a memorable quote uttered by Tom Hardy to Joseph Gordon Levitt from the 2010 film Inception.**

* **4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate**
  * File : [4-pow_recursion.c](./4-pow_recursion.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
    * Expected Results : If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1

> ðŸ’¡Fun Fact : 
> * **"Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate. An idea that is fully formed - fully understood - that sticks; right in there somewhere.**

* **5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer**
  * File : [5-sqrt_recursion.c](./5-sqrt_recursion.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that returns the natural square root of a number.
    * Expected Results : If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1.

> ðŸ’¡**Fun Fact : â€œArthur : Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer; me. Inception (2010)**

<br>

* **6. Inception. Is it possible?**
  * File : [6-is_prime_number.c](./6-is_prime_number.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A  a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

* **7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything**
  * File : [100-is_palindrome.c](./100-is_palindrome.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.
    * Note : An empty string is a palindrome

* **8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...**
  * File : [101-wildcmp.c](./101-wildcmp.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.
    * Expected Results : 
      * **s2 can contain the special character *.**
      * **The special char * can replace any string (including an empty string)**
