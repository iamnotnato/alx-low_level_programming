<h3>Project : 0x0A. C - argc, argv</h3>
<br>

<h4>Essentials:</h4>

* [main.h](./main.h) : A Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.
* [_putchar.c](./_putchar.c) : A C function that writes a character to `stdout`.

<h4>List of Tasks:</h4>
<br>

* **0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to**
  * File : [0-whatsmyname.c](./0-whatsmyname.c)

    * Expected Results : 
      * **If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again**
      * **You should not remove the path before the name of the program**

* **2. The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter**
  * File : [2-args.c](./2-args.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A program that prints all arguments it receives.

* **3. Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument**
  * File : [3-mul.c](./3-mul.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A program that multiplies two numbers.
    * Expected Results : 
      * **Your program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line**
      * **You can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer**
      * **If the program does not receive two arguments,**
        * **Your program should print Error,followed by a new line, and return 1**

* **4. To infinity and beyond**
  * File : [4-add.c](./4-add.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A program that adds positive numbers.
    * Expected Results : 
      * **Print the result, followed by a new line**
      * **If no number is passed to the program, print 0, followed by a new line**
      * **You can assume that numbers and the addition of all the numbers can be stored in an int**
      * **If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits**
        * **Your program should print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1**

* **5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer**
  * File : [5-sqrt_recursion.c](./5-sqrt_recursion.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that returns the natural square root of a number.
    * Expected Results : If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1.

* **7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything**
  * File : [100-is_palindrome.c](./100-is_palindrome.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.
    * Note : An empty string is a palindrome
