<h3>Project : C - 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings.</h3>

<h4>Notes: </h4>

* **ltrace is a program that simply runs the specified command until it exits.**
* **It intercepts and records the dynamic library calls which are called by the executed process and the signals which are received by that process.** 
* **It can also intercept and print the system calls executed by the program.**

<h4>Essentials:</h4>

* [main.h](./main.h) : A Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.

<h4>Prototypes Required:</h4>

<h4>List of Tasks:</h4>

* **0. memset**
  * File : [0-memset.c](./0-memset.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that fills memory with a constant byte.
    * Expected Results :
      *The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b.
      *Returns a pointer to the memory area s.
 <br><br>

* **1. memcpy**
  * File : [1-memcpy.c](./1-memcpy.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that copies memory area.
    * Expected Results :
      *The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest.
      *Returns a pointer to dest.
 <br><br>
  
* **2. strncpy**
  * File : [2-strncpy.c](./2-strncpy.c)
    * RequiredÂ : Your function should work exactly like strncpy.
    * Expected Results : Your function should work exactly like strncpy.
 <br><br>
  
* **3. strcmp**
  * File : [3-strcmp.c](./3-strcmp.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that compares two strings.
    * Expected Results : Your function should work exactly like strcmp.
 <br><br>

* **4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy**
  * File : [4-rev_array.c](./4-rev_array.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
    * Expected Results : Where n is the number of elements of the array.
 <br><br>
  
* **5. Always look up**
  * File : [5-string_toupper.c](./5-string_toupper.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
    * Expected Results : A function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
 <br><br>

* **6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes**
  * File : [6-cap_string.c](./6-cap_string.c)
    * RequiredÂ : Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.
    * Expected Results : Separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and }
 <br><br>
  
* **7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody**
  * File : [7-leet.c](./7-leet.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that encodes a string into 1337.
    * Expected Results : You are not allowed to use any ternary operation.
 <br><br>

* **8. rot13**
  * File : [100-rot13.c](./100-rot13.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that encodes a string using rot13.
