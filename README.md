> üìù **Footnotes**

> ‚öôÔ∏è **Compiler Flags:**

> üèÅ **gcc** : Invokes the GNU C compiler. 

<br>

> üèÅ **-Wall** : This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros.

<br>

> üèÅ **-pedantic** : Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++; reject all programs that use forbidden extensions.
> 
> Some other programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++. For ISO C, follows the version of the ISO C standard specified by any -std option used.

<br>

> üèÅ **-Werror** : Make all warnings into errors.

<br>

> üèÅ **-Wextra** : This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by -Wall.

<br>

> üèÅ **-std=gnu89** :  Determine the language standard.
> 
> This option is currently only supported when compiling C or C++.
> 
> The compiler can accept several base standards, such as `c89` or `c++98`, and GNU dialects of those standards, such as `gnu89` or `gnu++98`.
> 
> By specifing a base standard, the compiler will accept all programs following that standard and those using GNU extensions that do not contradict it.
> 
> For example, `-std=c89` turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO C90, such as the asm and typeof keywords, but not other GNU extensions that do not have a meaning in ISO C90, such as omitting the middle term of a ?: expression.
> 
> On the other hand, by specifing a GNU dialect of a standard, all features the compiler support are enabled, even when those features change the meaning of the base standard and some strict-conforming programs may be rejected. 
> 
> The particular standard is used by -pedantic to identify which features are GNU extensions given that version of the standard. For example `-std=gnu89 -pedantic` would warn about C++ style `//` comments, while `-std=gnu99 -pedantic` would not.
> 
> A value for this option must be provided; possible values are
>
> `c89`
> `iso9899:1990`
> 
> Support all ISO C90 programs (certain GNU extensions that conflict with ISO C90 are disabled).
> 
> Same as -ansi for C code.

<br>

> üìù **Endnotes**

> Every C program has a primary function that must be named main. 
> 
> The main function serves as the starting point for program execution. 
> 
> It usually controls program execution by directing the calls to other functions in the program.

> Several restrictions apply to the main function that don't apply to any other C functions. The main function:

> * **Can't be declared as inline.**
> * **Can't be declared as static.**
> * **Can't have its address taken.**
> * **Can't be called from your program.**
