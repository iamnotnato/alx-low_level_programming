> 📑 **Task :** A function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
> 📝 **Required :** 
      * **Where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed.**
      * **Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space.**
      * **The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array.**

> 💡Fun Fact :
>
> - **Van der Linden discusses in his book Deep C Secrets is how “arrays are not pointers“.**
> - **This can be dangerous because it sets the wrong tone, and is really a half-truth.**
> - **It’s a bit of a chicken and egg problem. Arrays look like pointers, and pointers can refer to array objects.**

<br>

> 📁 **9. strcpy**
> 💾 **File :** [9-strcpy.c](./9-strcpy.c)
> 📑 **Task :** A function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
> 📝 **Required :**  Return value: the pointer to dest
<br>

> 📁 **10. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers**

> 📑 **Task :** A function that convert a string to an integer.
> 📝 **Required :** 
      * *The number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters.*
      * *You need to take into account all the - and + signs before the number.*
      * *If there are no numbers in the string, the function must return 0.*
      * *You are not allowed to use long.*
      * *You are not allowed to declare new variables of “type” array.*
      * *You are not allowed to hard-code special values.*
      * *We will use the -fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow gcc flag to compile your code.*
