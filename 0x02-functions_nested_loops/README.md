<h4>Footnotes<h4>
The Fibonacci sequence is a series  of numbers in which a given number  
1:05
is the addition of the two numbers before it. So, if you start with 0, the next number  
1:10
will be 1, followed by 1, followed  by 2, followed by 3 and so on.  
1:16
(not to be spoken in audio) 0, 1,  1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55‚Ä¶..  
1:17
As you can see, every number in this series or  sequence is obtained by adding the two preceding  
1:22
numbers. This simple series of numbers is  referred to as the Fibonacci sequence for  
1:26
Fibonacci series. And individual numbers in this  sequence are often called Fibonacci numbers.  
1:28
Mathematically, the fibonacci sequence  is represented with this formula  
1:31
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) (not  to be spoken in audio)  
1:32
where n>1 You can use this expression  
1:36
to find any ‚Äòn‚Äôth digit in the sequence. This fascinating sequence is widely associated  
1:42
with the mathematician, Leonardo Pisano, aka  Fibonacci. He hailed from the Republic of Pisa,  
1:49
which is why he is also known as Leonardo  of Pisa and was known as one of the most  
1:53
talented mathematicians of the Middle ages. At the time, Europeans were still using Roman  
1:59
numbers while Hindu-Arabic mathematicians  were using a different number system  
2:03
which was more robust and efficient. Fascinated by  the brilliance of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system,  
2:09
Fibonacci brought them to the western world in  1202 through his now-famous book Liber Abaci.  
2:15
In the book, he reviewed and compared the  Hindu-Arabic numeral system with other systems,  
2:20
such as Roman numerals, and described  how using the Hindu-Arabic system made  
2:24
calculations faster and easier. Although his book contains the  
2:28
earliest known description of the  Fibonacci sequence outside of India,  
2:32
it has been described in ancient Indian texts  by mathematicians as early as the 6th century.  
2:38
So, what makes the Fibonacci sequence so special? To the uninitiated, it may just seem like a series  
2:45
of numbers, but the Fibonacci sequence has been  discovered and rediscovered in various forms,  
2:50
not only in mathematics, but also  in nature and our everyday lives.  
2:56
There‚Äôs another exciting offshoot of the  Fibonacci sequence - the golden ratio.  
3:01
Suppose you have two quantities, A  and B, wherein A is greater than B.  
3:06
Now, add A and B and divide the sum by  A. If this ratio comes out to be equal  
3:12
to the ratio of A and B, then you‚Äôd  say that A and B have a golden ratio.  
3:17
It‚Äôs represented by the Greek letter phi ( œï ). Write down the Fibonacci sequence on a piece  
3:22
of paper and calculate the ratio using  this formula. You will notice that all  
3:26
Fibonacci numbers have the golden ratio,  the value of which is close to 1.618033‚Ä¶  
3:35
In geometry, when the golden ratio is applied  as a growth factor, you get a special kind of  
3:39
logarithmic spiral known as a golden spiral.  Simply put, a golden spiral gets wider by a  
3:46
factor of phi for every quarter turn it makes. You‚Äôll find examples and manifestations  
3:51
of golden ratio and golden spirals in  countless places in your everyday life.  
3:56
Seashells are one of the most common examples  of the golden spiral in nature. Ocean waves,  
4:01
hurricanes, flower buds, snail shells, spider webs  are some of the many naturally-occurring examples. 
4:09
Many artists use the golden ratio or spiral  in their creative works. Legendary painter  
4:15
Salvador Dali explicitly used the ratio in his  masterpiece The Sacrament of the Last Supper.  
4:21
Architects often use the golden ratio in designing  buildings and massive other massive structures.  
4:26
Popular Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier,  who is widely acclaimed as one of the pioneers  
4:31
of modern architecture, explicitly used  the golden ratio in his Modulor system  
4:36
for the scale of architectural proportion. From snail shells to flowers, from bananas to  
4:38
the inside of the human ear, from large,  iconic buildings to galaxies, the golden  
4:44
ratio can be seen everywhere. This is probably  why it‚Äôs also known as the divine proportion.  
4:49
There are so many places where you can find the  golden ratio or the Fibonacci numbers that it‚Äôs  
4:53
impossible to list all of them in one place and  be done with it, because the list is ever-growing.  
4:58
