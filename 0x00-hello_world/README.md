> ⚙️ **Compiler Flags:**

> 🏁 gcc : Invokes the GNU C compiler. 
>
> 🏁 -Wall : This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros.
>
> 🏁 -pedantic : Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++; reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++. For ISO C, follows the version of the ISO C standard specified by any -std option used.
>
> 🏁 -Werror : Make all warnings into errors.
>
> 🏁 -Wextra : This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by -Wall.
>
> 🏁 -std=gnu89 :  Determine the language standard. See Language Standards Supported by GCC, for details of these standard versions. This option is currently only supported when compiling C or C++.
> The compiler can accept several base standards, such as `c89' or `c++98', and GNU dialects of those standards, such as `gnu89' or `gnu++98'.
> By specifing a base standard, the compiler will accept all programs following that standard and those using GNU extensions that do not contradict it.
> For example, `-std=c89' turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO C90, such as the asm and typeof keywords, but not other GNU extensions that do not have a meaning in ISO C90, such as omitting the middle term of a ?: expression.
> On the other hand, by specifing a GNU dialect of a standard, all features the compiler support are enabled, even when those features change the meaning of the base standard and some strict-conforming programs may be rejected. 
> The particular standard is used by -pedantic to identify which features are GNU extensions given that version of the standard. For example `-std=gnu89 -pedantic' would warn about C++ style `//' comments, while `-std=gnu99 -pedantic' would not.
> A value for this option must be provided; possible values are
>
> `c89'
> `iso9899:1990'
> Support all ISO C90 programs (certain GNU extensions that conflict with ISO C90 are disabled). Same as -ansi for C code.|
