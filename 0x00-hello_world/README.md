  * File : [1-compiler](./1-compiler)
     * RequiredÂ : A script that compiles a C file but does not link.

<br>

* **2. Assembler**
  * File : [2-assembler](./2-assembler)
     * RequiredÂ : A script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
     * Expected Results : The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.
<br>

* **3. Name**
  * File : [3-name](./3-name)
    * RequiredÂ : A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.

<br>

* **4. Hello, puts**
  * File : [4-puts.c](./4-puts.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
    * Expected Results :
      * Use the function puts.
      * You are not allowed to use printf.
      * Your program should end with the value 0.
<br>

* **5. Hello, printf**
  * File : [5-printf.c](./5-printf.c)
    * RequiredÂ : a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.
    * Expected Results : 
      * Use the function printf.
      * You are not allowed to use the function puts.
      * Your program should return 0.

<br>

* **6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation**
  * File : [6-size.c](./6-size.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
    * Expected Results : The output should be the same as the example provided.

* **7. Intel**
  * File : [100-intel](./100-intel)
    * RequiredÂ : A script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
    * Expected Results : The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.

* **8. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity**
  * File : [101-quote.c](./101-quote.c)
    * RequiredÂ :  A C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
    * Expected Results : 
      * You are not allowed to use any functions listed in the NAME section of the man (3) printf or man (3) puts.
      * Your program should return 1.
      * Your program should compile without any warnings when using the -Wall gcc option.
