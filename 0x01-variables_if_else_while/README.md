<br>

* **0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
  * File : [0-positive_or_negative.c](./0-positive_or_negative.c)
    * Required : Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
    * Expected Results : The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program.

<br>

* **1. The last digit**
  * File : [1-last_digit.c](./1-last_digit.c)
    * Required : Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
    * Expected Results : The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program.
<br>

* **2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
  * File : [2-print_alphabet.c](./2-print_alphabet.c)
    * Required : A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
    * Expected Results : You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden).

    * Required : A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
    * Expected Results : You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
<br>

* **4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
  * File : [4-print_alphabt.c](./4-print_alphabt.c)
    * Required : A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

    * Expected Results : All your code should be in the main function.
<br>

* **6. Numberz**
  * File : [6-print_numberz.c](./6-print_numberz.c)
    * Required : A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
