<h3>Project : 0x08-recursion</h3>
<br>

<h4>Essentials:</h4>

* [main.h](./main.h) : A Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.
* [_putchar.c](./_putchar.c) : A C function that writes a character to `stdout`.

<h4>Prototypes Required:</h4>

| `2-strlen_recursion.c`       | `int _strlen_recursion(char *s);`       |
| `3-factorial.c`              | `int factorial(int n);`                 |
| `4-pow_recursion.c`          | `int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);`     |
| `5-sqrt_recursion.c`         | `int _sqrt_recursion(int n);`           |

* **1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together**
  * File : [1-print_rev_recursion.c](./1-print_rev_recursion.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that prints a string in reverse.

* **2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange**
  * File : [2-strlen_recursion.c](./2-strlen_recursion.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that returns the length of a string.

* **3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling**
  * File : [3-factorial.c](./3-factorial.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that returns the factorial of a given number.
    * Expected Results : 
      * **If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error.**
      * **Factorial of 0 is 1.**

* **4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate**
  * File : [4-pow_recursion.c](./4-pow_recursion.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
    * Expected Results : If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1

* **5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer**
  * File : [5-sqrt_recursion.c](./5-sqrt_recursion.c)
    * RequiredÂ : A function that returns the natural square root of a number.
    * Expected Results : If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1.

    * RequiredÂ : A function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.
    * Note : An empty string is a palindrome
