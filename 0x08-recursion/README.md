<h4>List of Tasks:</h4>

* **0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget**
  * File : [0-puts_recursion.c](./0-puts_recursion.c)
    * Required¬†: A function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

üí°*Fun Fact : "She had locked something away,something deep inside.*
   * **A truth that she had once known,but chose to forget. ‚Äï Christopher J. Nolan, Inception: The Shooting Script**
<br><br>

* **1. memcpy**
  * File : [1-memcpy.c](./1-memcpy.c)
    * Required¬†: A function that copies memory area.
    * Expected Results :
      * **The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest.**
      * **Returns a pointer to dest.**
 <br><br>
  
* **2. strchr**
  * File : [2-strchr.c](./2-strchr.c)
    * Required¬†: A function that locates a character in a string.
    * Expected Results : Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found
 <br><br>
  
* **3. strspn**
  * File : [3-strspn.c](./3-strspn.c)
    * Required¬†: A function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
    * Expected Results : Returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept
 <br><br>

* **4. strpbrk**
  * File : [4-strpbrk.c](./4-strpbrk.c)
    * Required¬†: A function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
    * Expected Results : 
      * **The _strpbrk() function locates the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept.**
      * **Returns a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if no such byte is found**
 <br><br>
  
* **5. strstr**
  * File : [5-strstr.c](./5-strstr.c)
    * Required¬†: A function that locates a substring.
    * Expected Results : 
      * **The _strstr() function finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack.**
      * **The terminating null bytes (\0) are not compared.**
      * **Returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.**
 <br><br>

* **6. Chess is mental torture**
  * File : [7-print_chessboard.c](./7-print_chessboard.c)
    * Required¬†: A function that prints the chessboard.

üí°*Fun Fact : ‚ÄúChess is mental torture‚Äù is what Garry Kasparov said in the context of his 1990s match vs Nigel Short.*
 <br><br>

* **7. The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire**
  * File : [8-print_diagsums.c](./8-print_diagsums.c)
    * Required¬†: A function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
    * Note : 
      * **The following example we are casting an int[][] into an int*.**
      * **This is not something you should do.** 
      * **The goal here is to make sure you understand how an array of array is stored in memory.**

üí°*Fun Fact : Quote by William R. Alger: The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire.*
 <br><br>

* **8. Double pointer, double fun**
  * File : [100-set_string.c](./100-set_string.c)
    * Required¬†: A function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
 <br><br>
  
* **9. My primary goal of hacking was the intellectual curiosity, the seduction of adventure**
  * File : [101-crackme_password](./101-crackme_password)
    * Required¬†: A file that contains the password for the crackme2 executable.
    * Expected Results : Your file should contain the exact password, no new line, no extra space.
