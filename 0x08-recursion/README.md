<br>

> üìë **Essentials:**

* [_putchar.c](./_putchar.c) : A C function that writes a character to `stdout`.
* [main.h](./main.h) : A Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.

<br>

> Prototypes Required:

| File                         | Prototype                               |
| -----------------------------| ----------------------------------------|
| `0-puts_recursion.c`         | `void _puts_recursion(char *s);`        |
| `1-print_rev_recursion.c`    | `void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);`   |
| `2-strlen_recursion.c`       | `int _strlen_recursion(char *s);`       |
| `3-factorial.c`              | `int factorial(int n);`                 |
| `4-pow_recursion.c`          | `int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);`     |
| `5-sqrt_recursion.c`         | `int _sqrt_recursion(int n);`           |
| `6-is_prime_number.c`        | `int is_prime_number(int n);`           |
| `100-is_palindrome.c`        | `int is_palindrome(char *s);`           |
| `101-wildcmp.c`              | `int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2);`      |

> üìë **Task¬†:**  A function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
>
>  ‚ÑπÔ∏è  **Hint:** The standard library provides a similar function: puts. Run man puts to learn more.

* **1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together**
  * File : [1-print_rev_recursion.c](./1-print_rev_recursion.c)
    * Required¬†: A function that prints a string in reverse.

* **2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange**
  * File : [2-strlen_recursion.c](./2-strlen_recursion.c)

* **3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling**
  * File : [3-factorial.c](./3-factorial.c)
    * Required¬†: A function that returns the factorial of a given number.
    * Expected Results : 
      * **If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error.**

  * File : [4-pow_recursion.c](./4-pow_recursion.c)
    * Required¬†: A function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
    * Expected Results : If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1
